# Movie-Recommender-System
Movie recommender systems are widely used by movie streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu to improve their users' movie-watching experience. By recommending movies that users are likely to enjoy, these platforms can increase user engagement and satisfaction, leading to increased user retention and revenue.

Building a movie recommender system involves several steps, including data collection, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Machine learning algorithms like collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and deep learning can be used to build effective movie recommender systems.
